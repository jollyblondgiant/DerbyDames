## Game Objective:
Outmaneuver and overwhelm your opponent.

have fun. make a mess.

## TEAM COMPOSITION:
a team is comprised of five skaters.
each skater is a single model and has the following attributes:
a name, a stable, a type, and the following stats:
a skater's STABLE represents her faction and my be affected by special abilities.
a skater's TYPE represents her specialty and affects team composition
a skater's BLOOD value represents her hardiness and stamina.
    whenever a skater falls, she loses BLOOD. when a skater has no BLOOD left,
    she is knoxked out an removed from play.
a akater's GUTS represents her momentum. her ability to trade hits.
   BLOCKING is defined below.

a team must have at least one jammer.
a team cannot have more than two jammers.
a team cannot ave more than one "Big Girl"


## LAYING THE TRACK:
place four tokens to use as posts on a 3 foot square tablw.
place each marker so that it is no less thank 6" from the center of the tble.
place each marker so that it is no more tha 9" from any other marker.
chooe a token to be "gat 1" the other three tokens will be gates 2, 3, and 4
in clockwise order.


## THE FACE OFF:
the two players flip a coin or roll off to decide the first player.
the privilege of first player may aldo be awarded to the player with 
    the gnarliest bruise.
starting with the first player, each player then places a non-jammer 
    skater within 6 inches of the first gate. 
once both players have placed all non-jammer skaters on the track, 
    they then place their jammers on the track at least 6 inches from 
    the first gate.
Each player, starting with the first player, then declares their star 
    skater.

## TAKING TURNS
Each round of play is comprised of each player, in turn, activating 
    one of her skaters at a time. On her turn, the active player 
    selects a skater that has not been activated yet and takes one of 
    the following actions:
MOVE BLOCK, RECOVER
then, play passes to the other player, who becomes the active player, 
    andactivates in turn a similar eligible skater.
The player to activate all of her units first will be the first player at the 
    top of the next round.

## MOVING
By default, skaters have a base movement of 6 inches. Some skaters have 
    a "Fast" attribute, so they move eight inches, and some have a 
    "slow" attribute, so they only move 4 inches.
A skater may move up to their movement. a skater does not have to move 
    her full movement. However, if she interrupts her movmement to take
    any other action, she cannot resume the rest of that movement.
Once a skater has moved up to her movement value, she may attempt a 
    SPRINT to move her movement value again, BLOCK an opoonent, or 
    ASSIST a teammate.
A star skater may execute her special move at any point during her
    activation, unless otherwise stipulated as part of the ability.
When a skater begins her activation within one inch of an opponent,
    and during her activation moves so that she is outside of that
    opponent's one inch radius, that opponent may attempt a free 
    BLOCK, aka an OPPORTUNITY BLOCK, on her. A skater may have to 
    contend with multiple OPPORTUNITY BLOCKS in this manner. 

## BLOCKING and ASSISTING
when a skater makes a BLOCK on another skater, she becomes the BLOCKING
    skater.
Each skater in the BLOCK compares GUTS.
The BLOCKING skater increases her GUTS by the number of teammates 
    within three inches of her, for the purposes of this block.
If The blocking skater's guts:
    ARE EQUAL to her target's, she rolls one BLOCK DIE.
    ARE GREATER THAN her target's, she rolls two BLOCK DICE.
    ARE TWICE AS GREAT OR MORE than her target's, 
        she rolls three BLOCK DICE.
For each BLOCK DIE:
a 1 or 2 is a FALL; the BLOCKING skater falls.
a 3 or 4 is a PUSH; the BLOCKING skater chooses a direction and moves
    the BLOCKED skater up to three inches away. a skater PUSHED ths 
    does not provoke OPPORTUNITY BLOCKS.
a 5 or 6 is a SLAM: the BLOCKED skater falls and takes a wound.

if a skater rolls a FALL, she must choose it and may not choose to
    PUSH nor SLAM.
a skater may elect to exchange any SLAMS rolled in order to "buy out"
    of a FALL. 

## RECOVERING
A FALLEN skater may take no action besides RECOVER, cannot move except
    to stand up, and does not contribute to her teammates' GUTS when 
    they attempt a BLOCK.
A FALLEN skater must roll a BLOCK DIE and add her wounds; if her total 
    is six or more, she faints, cannot recover, and is removed from 
    the game.

## SCORING POINTS
when one player's JAMMER has moved within three inches of each gate 
    in counterclockwise  order from the first to the fourth and
    once again passes the first gate, she scores one point.

## ENDING THE MATCH
The match ends after X rounds. Each skater removed from the track, due
    to wounds or as a result of special abilities, counts as a point to
    the opponent player. 

##TODO:
special pickups on gates 2-4
star skater abilities
strength/movement balancing for teams-- start everybody off on 3/3
