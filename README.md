still thinking about teams balancing, esp. biggurls and star skaters.

## lore ideas:
	
# Goblins: Shredders of Rad Canyon
	Rad Canyon is a volatile dangerous landscape. 
	It has dragons which are like ankylosaurs.
	or armored, lava-belching komodo dragons.
	"Dragomodos"
	These dragons are prized for their eight-chambered heart
	which is used as a powerful engine.
	The dragomodos and volcanic activity has turned Shred Canyon into
	a haphazard, jagged maze of obsidian lanes. Goblins, the people
	most adapted to the environment, are therefore amazing, nimble skaters,
	fearless and ruthless.

# Humans: JotunHeim Valkyries
	The echoes of the RadWar still linger here in the icy regions of JotunHeim,
	where the frozen bones of titans break up the bleak landscape. An eternal winter
	dominates the sky and the people who live below it. JotunHeimers, incredcibly
	hardy people for the cruelty of their home climes, traverse the poisonous country
	quickly over frozen rivers. On the rare clear night, the rainbow bridge descends 
	from the heavens and the Valkyries arrive to tear ass.

# Demons: Beelze-Babes	
	They skate the highways of hell
	They need to claim souls in order to buy their way up into greater eschelons
	If they lose they get torn to bits cenobite style
	They generally come to claim the souls of liars, oathbreakers, and anyone they don't like.
	They come skate to claim souls
